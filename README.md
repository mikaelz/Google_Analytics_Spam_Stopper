# Google Analytics Spam Stopper

A simple tool to take a list of spam domains, concatenate them to be input into Google Analytics and remove them from your referral lists. 

To run, from a command line go to the node folder, and run "node run.js", and in the root directory you will not have an output file with the long string to be copied and pasted into GA.
